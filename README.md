## Inspiration

To create this `readme`, I searched for some standard readme and found a
very simple article with a tutorial that I liked: [bulldogjob.com](https://bulldogjob.com/news/449-how-to-write-a-good-readme-for-your-github-project) and [Ritaly's github repository](https://github.com/ritaly/README-cheatsheet).
